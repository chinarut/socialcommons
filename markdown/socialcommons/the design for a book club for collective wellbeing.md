- [[A wellbeing commons is an open digital garden where participants learn to creatively share and connect a vast array of personal experience and wisdom such that it results in collective breakthrough]]
    - #backstory I've been wondering for quite some time how a book club might look like if everyone were to bring **five** books they feel would constitute how [[The 5 Essential Elements of Wellbeing]] looks like in their life.  this could easily be a year-long effort as there would be 6 books total (1 in common, 5 of your choosing) to take on. [*](((UGBQZpeIX)))
        - an alternative structure would be to focus on synthesizing these 2 books
            - inner: [[The 5 Essential Elements of Wellbeing]]
            - outer: [[The Zeitgeist Movement Defined]]
    - read more behind the context behind a [[Wellbeing Commons]]
- key distinctions from past book clubs [*](((WQ8ZpOe-l)))
    - **choose your own adventure** - giving participants the opportunity to choose a book consistent with the cohort‚Äôs theme [*](((P34QxngDt)))
        - each cohort gets to pick a book (specific to their element) [*](((rHn7OC0wj)))
        - it is likely a 6th cohort focuses on integration and synthesis (breadth over depth)
    - **organizing by meta framework** in support of the thematic approach to book club
    - exploring individual wellbeing and it‚Äôs **connection to universal wellbeing** 
    - individuals choose a **line of inquiry to lead and follow through** to completion
    - learning to **navigate contrasting perspectives** (both internally and with the group)
        - crafting zettels from multiple sources/books (not just one book)
            - this better reflects real-world experience
        - provided you are contributing to your cohort - you are welcome to participate and help expand the conversations in other cohorts
    -  #stretch Be an **active testbed** for features in development enabling intergraph communication
        - individual profile pages (and slipboxes) are hosted in personal graphs

    - [[Being curious and following our interests keeps us connected to our personal goals and makes building autonomy around wellbeing fun]]
    - [[Wellbeing is inter-disciplinary in nature thus there exists many models and frameworks for wellbeing. Having a note-taking method capturing differing perspectives expands the richness of dialogue able to express wellbeing at multiple levels of abstraction]]
    - [[A collective slipbox is a network of individuals. Every individual has a unique blueprint for optimum wellbeing. Every time we add an individual to the slipbox, we expand the richness of interconnected concepts and abstractions elevating our collective wellbeing]]
- assertions/assumptions
    - it is a good idea to start with [[The 5 Essential Elements of Wellbeing]] as a unified framework
        - [[The 5 Essential Elements of Wellbeing]] is more ‚Äúhands on‚Äù and accessible (ie. personal development) than [[The Zeitgeist Movement Defined]] (ie. systemic global transformation of society‚Äôs biggest challenges) - both are "holistic" in differing ways
