- This an excerpt of the original [Business Model You Cheatsheet](http://is.gd/bmycheatsheet) with a focus on discovering your gift for community in as little as 10-15 minutes.
    - This method is built on the work of the [Business Model You](http://www.businessmodelyou.com) available in our Creative Commons
- I picked this structure as I thought it would be a unique way to capture the various insights you have around the 5 elements over the next few weeks
    - It is a reusable tool to support you in exploring and designing the life narrative you want
- Take a blank piece of paper (at least 8.5x11“ or A4) and sketch the lines of the framework above with the 9 sections.  (for those of you who have something called a printer, you may print [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1arq4fd4s6bsI1H5sgA_0fZzCm_Qmxt4x/view?usp=sharing) out :)
- Start your model by jotting down, in each block, **a word or phrase **that first comes to mind as you visit each section - there are no right or wrong answers:
- The suggested sequence

        1. **Who you are & what you have** - what excites you about community in a word or two?
        2. **What you do** - what is an activity you might do to give back to a community you appreciate?
        3. **Who you help** - what community is this?
        4. **How you help** - what do you feel this community gets as a result of your gratitude?
        5. **How they know you & how you deliver** - where do people in this community often find you expressing appreciation?
        6. **How you interact** - what kind of relationship do you create with members of this community?
        7. **Who helps you** - who supports you in maintaining a connection to this community?
        8. **What you get** - what do you get?  what’s in it for you?  how does it make you feel?
        9. **What you give** - what do you give? (could be material or an intangible feeling)
- If you have written at least one item in each of the 9 blocks, congratulations, you have your 1st iteration of your personal business model!   What you have is a blueprint for your community.  We invite you to share your model and your insights with the person (or community!) you identified as a key partner (# 7).
- examples of where elements will show up during the next few weeks:
    - #purpose - who you are, how you help (value you provide)
    - #social - who helps you, how you interact
    - #financial - what you get (and what you give for some)
    - #physical - what you give
    - #community - who you help, who helps you
- In the event a hard focus on community does not land for you or you are interested in learning more about how the [Business Model You](http://www.businessmodelyou.com/) can transform your career, you’re invited to review the original [Business Model You Cheatsheet](http://is.gd/bmycheatsheet) in more detail.
- Thanks for taking time to stop and reflect upon what matters to you!
