        - Problem of¬†**synthesizing** diverse lines of evidence --- e.g., primary and secondary research literature, wisdom and religious literature, personal experiences, ideas from others, personal experiments --- ^^to¬†empower individuals to take action towards wellbeing^^
        - Possibility of¬†**sharing**¬†partial starting points for synthesis in a social commons (perhaps a network of personal knowledge graphs or wikis, overlaid on top of various literatures)

            - what is a commons?
                - ‚Äúa compelling question that is also very very high level‚Äù
            - how is a commons model for wellbeing different from what we have today? [[wellbeing commons]]
            - how do we know what is [[wellbeing knowledge]] and what is not?
            - how will [[ownership of wellbeing information]] be handled? [[ownership of information]]
            - how do we motivate people to take action towards wellbeing? [[motivation to act]]
                - how do we know when actions people take are consistent with [[elevating wellbeing]]?
            - what gets in the way of people taking action towards wellbeing? [[barriers to wellbeing]]

    - Take notes with an intent to find them later and share publishable insight. The goal is to leverage our brain for thinking, not remembering, and maintain a set of permanent notes to give us the freedom to let go (or archive or trash) old notes so the quality of our notes improve over time. This includes old project notes (like todos, drafts, etc) once the project is complete. #[[Literature Notes]]

        - In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?

        - Instead of focusing on the in-between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems, reading techniques or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published.

        - The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering.
        - Pink highlight | Page: 42
        - One of the major reasons for not getting much writing or publishing done lies in the confusion of these categories.

            - sounds like my #Evernote system!
        - Pink highlight | Page: 43
        - the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep.
            - oh boy.. so clearly 20,000 notes in Evernote is **not** a good thing if they have not been fully processed and synthesized...
                - it is the opposite if you keep meaningful permanent notes ‚Äúplaying‚Äù together #post-lit
            - ^^More notes will make it more difficult to retrieve the right ones and bring related ones together in a playful way. But it should be just the opposite^^ #post-lit

        - ^^**The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become**^^

        - Fleeting notes are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else.
        - Orange highlight | Page: 44
        - Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later.
        - Blue highlight | Page: 44
        - Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from.
        - Blue highlight | Page: 45
        - Some notes might disappear into the background and never catch his attention again, while others might become connection points to various lines of reasoning and reappear on a regular basis in various contexts.
        - Blue highlight | Page: 45
        - because every note is in the same format at the same place can they later be combined and assembled into something new and **no thought is ever wasted** on the question of where to put or label it.
        - Orange highlight | Page: 46
        - When you close the folder for your current project in the evening and nothing is left on your desk other than pen and paper, you know that you have achieved a clear separation between fleeting, permanent and project-related notes.

The slip-box not only provides us with the opportunity to learn in this proven way, it forces us to do exactly what is recommended just by using it. We have to elaborate on what we read just to be able to write it down and translate it into different contexts.

            - is this the nature of complacency?
        - ^^The trick is not to try to break with old habits^^ [*](((4hIM0I_l_)))
            - don‚Äôt drop habits cold turkey. let new habits **replace** old habits.

    - Index:: ^^[[wellbeing education]]^^ [[fallacy of top-down]] [[lifelong structures for transformation]] [[declaration as synthesis]] [[synthesis of experience]] [[access to experience beyond self]] ^^[[life as wellbeing]]^^
    - We transform education by giving up the fallacy of top-down organization of curricula and teach students to see writing as a system to synthesize diverse information. We encourage them to build a simple long-term learning structure through writing. When a student sees beyond themselves, they shift their thinking and writing becomes the source of transformation. #[[Literature Notes]]

            - ^^the long-term, cross-topic organization of notes, which is guided only by one‚Äôs own understanding and interest, is very much at odds with the modular, compartmentalised and top-down approach in which the curricula of universities and colleges are organised.^^ [*](((QVfNEbAfL)))
                - so how is someone supposed to choose what dept to apply for their studies? #inquiry
            - ^^Teaching is still set up for review, and students are not really encouraged to [[independently build a network of connections between heterogeneous information]] ‚Äì despite the radical change in our understanding on how our memory and learning works.^^ [*](((QVfNEbAfL)))
                - this sounds like a requirement as a student!
        - ()
            - ^^The slip-box does not put the learner in the centre. Quite the contrary: It allows the learner to let his or her own thinking become [[decentralised within a network of other ideas]].^^ [*](((AEToJgvmY)))
                - important element of becoming objective
            - ^^Learning, thinking and writing should not be about accumulating knowledge, but about becoming a different person with a different way of thinking.^^ [*](((AEToJgvmY)))
                - i would argue ‚Äúdifferent way of **being**!‚Äù [[nature of transformation]]
                - absolutely hear being open to ‚Äúblind spots‚Äù and [[embracing the unknown]]
        - ^^the basis for that is a deep understanding on how and why it works and how the different steps and tasks of writing fit together.^^ [*](((ID232vsr4)))
            - understanding writing at a really fundamental level - just like mathematics!
        - ()
            - ^^most students only realise the need for a good system when they already struggling with their writing^^ [*](((SF8pUW-gw)))
                - I‚Äôm struggled to write my a [[Statement of Purpose]] (and [[one-page proposal]]s)
                - I did have the insight to know I use sheer willpower to synthesize and that I am burnt out by the way I‚Äôve been doing it. I had the insight to know starting over with a blank piece of paper every time was part of the problem (that is was causing fragmentation). I had the insight to know there was a better way but little did I know I would have the luck to have this book land in my hands!
            - ^^it would have helped much more if one started earlier ‚Äì very much like saving for retirement.^^ [*](((SF8pUW-gw)))
                - *sigh* I can relate to **feeling** like I haven‚Äôt saved up for retirement ‚Äúearly‚Äù enough...
                - this makes me feel it is imperative students learn this method **now**
                    - {{[[DONE]]}}  insist Fisher pick this book up now!
            - ^^It is also difficult to change behaviour in times of stress.^^ [*](((SF8pUW-gw)))
                - yes, it seems absolutely crazy to pick up Zettlekasten when I feel I should just sit in front of a blank page and just write (which we know doesn‚Äôt work very well - old habits die hard!)
            - ^^Change is possible when the solution appears to be simple.^^ [*](((SF8pUW-gw)))
                - yes - this seems simple enough indeed!  I am wondering what it will take to learn what are mostly fleeting notes into literature notes...

        - it is okay to craft permanent notes off the bat
        - very NLP :P)
