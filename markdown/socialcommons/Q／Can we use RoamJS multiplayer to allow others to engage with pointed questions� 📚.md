        - Chinarut:: goal is the possibility of cross-syncing [[üêù Hivemind]] across graphs 
            - to be clear, for the privacy of everyone here, I am **not** enabling this extension in this graph until fully discussed with organizing team
            - contact me if you‚Äôd like to experiment with me in 2 sandbox graphs to implement [roamjs/multiplayer](https://roamjs.com/extensions/multiplayer)
            - something I‚Äôm experimenting with is how to best engage with experts/advisors/colleagues/community members who were not part of RBC7 (for whatever reason) that can potentially share additional perspective to answer the question: [[Q/How do we sustain the development of a Wellbeing Commons? üìö]]
                - one could argue these are potential #community wellbeing advisors at the level of group/collective (defined by RBC7)
