- Desired Results
    - Purpose
        - for you to have a breakthrough in your self-care such that it results in a breakthrough in the wellbeing of those around you and be present to the possibility of socio-economic transformation being alive and real
        - to clarify through exploration and discovery what is of value to you as it relates to a holistic, social impact centered conversation for wellbeing
        - to push the boundaries of what is possible with global collaboration hosting a public social commons in Roam Research
        - #[[long tail]] game: [[socio-economic transformation]] - a clear break from our [[market economy]] (as it exists in 2021)
    - Outcomes
        1. [[Wellbeing 5 Advisory]] of 6 members (5 elements, 1 director)
        2. 20 active participants in [[üìú Directory of Members]]
            - intended audience are social activists committed to [[socio-economic transformation]]
                - [[The Zeitgeist Movement]] (aka TZM) community
                - [[Gallup]] community and coaches
                - [[roam book club]] members interested in social impact

                    - [[Sutra]] community
        3. [[Wellbeing Commons]] prototype in Roam Research
            - [[How a Wellbeing Commons Works]] (intent is to provide a POV, not to be attached to how or methods!)
- Guidelines
    - start with 2 existing frameworks (and communities) around wellbeing (micro) and socio-economic transformation (macro)
        1. [[The 5 Essential Elements of Wellbeing]] - book focusing on grounding your relationship and experience of wellbeing in the context of 5 elements
        2. [[The Zeitgeist Movement Defined]] - book in public domain centered around transforming [[public health]] and [[human rights]]
    - Best Practices
        - focus on [[technical efficiency]] over [[market efficiency]]
- Resources
    - [[Chinarut]] is using 1 of his 3 graphs to host this effort under a Roam Scholar account
        - [[Chinarut]] agrees to contribute 25 years of experience in knowledge engineering and digital garden formation and development to this graph
    - [[Chinarut]] has extensive experience experimenting with framing [[The 5 Essential Elements of Wellbeing]] into one‚Äôs life between 2014-2021
        - [Anchoring Your Wellbeing Advisory](https://www.notion.so/communitygarden/Anchoring-Your-Wellbeing-5-Advisory-b4cba9a9dc234fb2b2aabd0454cf19df)
        - [[Chinarut]] agrees to be the [[acting director]] of the [[Wellbeing 5 Advisory]] and this social commons
            1. establishing funding to sustain our efforts
            2. moderating and overseeing the development of milestones
            3. enlisting strategic partnerships in support of our goals
- Accountability
    - Timelines
        - check-in asynchronously at least once a week
            - review, block reference comment, and/or react to daily notes other participants have written
            - write your own daily notes as they are present
        - agree to iterate for 10 weeks and have a meta-discussion to acknowledge what is emerging and next steps
- Consequences
    - a successful prototype is input into
        1. a crowdfunding campaign championing the importance of this effort
            - why this resource must exist
            - serve as a form of ‚Äúsimulated‚Äù [[Universal Basic Income (UBI)]] for the 6 members that constitute the [[Wellbeing 5 Advisory]] and its director
            - build groundswell
        2. a PhD proposal [[Chinarut]] is willing to make to establish institutional and academic support to expand our efforts over the course of 5 years [[November 1st, 2021]]
    - failure to fund this project results in a discussion with the [[Wellbeing 5 Advisory]] and the [[üìú Directory of Members]] as to
        1. the future of the existence of this graph
        2. what will happen to the intellectual property developed (with an intent to maintain public domain access)
