        - Love your goals and how you're going about your Zettels. Well done sir!
            - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] thank you for dropping by and the complements! you motivated me to review [my goals](((9rOs4QMsG))) and remind myself why I‚Äôm here (not to mention fix lots of typos :) I am really curious, is there anything in particular you feel I‚Äôm doing right with my zettels? sometimes I feel lost in a zettelstorm :D I‚Äôm glad to provide inspiration! üôèüèº
    - #Chat  [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]] I was wondering about the links you place just under the chapter links for the book. Are these pages for concepts you've already been thinking of? Or things that you want to think more about? Please elaborate. Thanks!

- [[üëãüèº]] Honor to be invited to be one of the #organizers of our book club! I hold [[a safe space to share what's working and not working for you]]. What popped out of RBC2 is a vision around [[How a Wellbeing Commons Works]] inspiring [[the design for a book club for collective wellbeing]]. As an [[engineer on the ship]], I look forward to exploring if conversations around a [[Zettel Map]] will (or will not!) help [[index and organize our community's expansive knowlege in way that creates relevance to what each and everyone is up to without the overwhelm]]. I believe our long-tail game is to #scout & [[enable the bookworms of the world to contribute to our conversation in such a way that it elevates our context and gives us challenging problems to be solved by Roam in conjunction with other platforms]].
- #strengths  1. #futuristic 2. #input 3. #strategic 4. #learner 5. #activator
    - in other words, i care about the future of book club taking in the MASSIVE input from society in a strategic way as a learning community and present to what we need to do NOW! :)

        - **Reflection on first reading phase of the book **
            - __I‚Äôm about halfway through the book__
            - **What ideas resonate with you from the book**
                - What is the gist of the book? 
                    - I think the gist of the book is that writing can be a natural process (and not sheer willpower) if we use some tried and true methods for collecting our ideas and synthesizing them together
                - that we are creating an idea generator
                - that there is no reason to ‚Äúsummarize‚Äù an idea generator
                    - you do your ‚Äúthinking‚Äù in the slip box itself
                - that there is a process for sequencing ideas, assembling into drafts and getting into final form
                - that there is light at the end of the tunnel in regards to how to bring all the ideas I have scattered around together!
            - **Discuss the fleeting note phase**
                - What does the concept of fleeting notes mean to you? 
                    - notes that just come up while reading the text (the first time) - in the moment, stream of consciousness
                - Define a fleeting note in your own words. 
                    - a fleeting note are notes that occur to you as you read the book the first time
                - How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method.
                    - I mostly spent my time highlighting the book (40% through)
                    - I did attempt to rephrase a few paragraphs I highlighted
                        - my biggest block is converting my list of highlights from Kindle and mapping them into text in Roam.
                - What is the value of fleeting notes?  For this book, and for previous books you have read? 
                    - I have notes in my own words, not just a bunch of quotes.
        - ((L_yS5Zkrd))
        - group sharing around the nature of fleeting notes
            - debate around limited space on flash card slip notes vs the ability to capture **everything** in Roam (and other digital tools)

                        - a literature note is a careful distillation of your fleeting notes [encapsulating the overall ideas from the author]
                    - ((f1ODSsQfy))
                        - I found it particularly useful to skim my fleeting notes (and highlights) and capture a set of concepts I thought encapsulated all of them.  I then crafted a sentence or two (or three) that captures all the concepts.
                            - example for chapter 1: [[getting unstuck]] [[value of adaptive structure]] [[idea process as structure]] [[cost of compartmentalization]] [[transforming GTD]] [[starting from abundance]] [[nature of control]] [[limitations of our brains]]
                    - ((Ps2snuEuK))
                        - it forces me to take random notes and highlights that just sit dust and actually **process** them and reword things in **my own words**.  This creates my own insight useful in future dialogue whether it is my own writing or future conversation with someone (or a group)
                    - ((SIN62h-E3))
                        - I wouldn‚Äôt call it a struggle. I think we‚Äôre winging it so I was inventing to process as I went.  In the beginning I was just taking highlights (and adding the occasional note in Kindle), then I tried block highlighting specific paragraphs and making fleeting notes in my own words as I went.  fundamentally I funneled everything into summarizing an entire chapter (at least up to chapter 4 which is how far I got by today)
                    - ((FWJ5P3PcV))
                        - just seeing relationships of concepts I‚Äôve developed and seeing who else has the same concepts in their sub-graph creates awesome jumping in points for getting to know others in the book club.  seeing other people‚Äôs notes around common block references is very insightful, too. I‚Äôm excited to see where this goes...

I love books that are not only transformational at a personal level and are also clear at a societal impact level - it‚Äôs clear [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] is out to alter the way we go about writing and help every sift through the noise in today‚Äôs deluge of information.  I love the difference he wants to make with students and academics and raise the bar with non-fiction writers.  it just leaves me curious where he feels the traction really is right now (if not with us :)
                    - ((I1HxFz57Q))
                        - absolutely!  it took a concerted effort to be able to use my own words, rearrange concepts (yet stay true to what he was saying). Forced me to ‚Äúthink‚Äù rather than just passively highlight :)

                        - while I clearly share this feeling with others - the feeling of ‚Äúbeing behind‚Äù and it is quite an investment learning the process the first time.  I can tell the way I highlight and write fleeting notes will continue to evolve and it will be great to create the habit of writing a [[Literature Note]] or even permanent notes right off the bat!
                    - ((DQX6BrRPZ))
                        - I think I might been a tad unrealistic about having the kind of permanent notes in my slipbox to drive assembling a [[Statement of Purpose]] for grad school by 11/29. What does seem realistic is a statement of purpose in the context of the book which I think, in 1500 words, will give a sense of my overall experience with the method, the presentation of the book, what it is doing for my writing and perhaps thoughts on the role I plan to take, personally, to champion what resonates most about this work into my everyday life.  All that said, I reviewed my first draft of my [[Statement of Purpose]] I wrote in the beginning of book club and I‚Äôm clear the 2nd draft will be completely different with a different kind of focus.  I think this is in part to witnessing how Sonke writes.

    - Process I use to create my literature notes
        - For each chapter (if it was short) or sub-chapter, I reviewed all my fleeting notes and Kindle highlights
            - #[[Question]]  So for now, you are reviewing fleeting notes and then creating literature notes when you are done with __each__ chapter, yes?
            - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] To be clear, each chapter is a distinct set of literature notes. I discovered my brain needed a break and was taxed if I attempted to do multiple chapters in one sitting (esp a multi-section chapter like 12 comes to mind!)
                - cramming might not be so hot as exercise aids the learning process (by alleviating stress hormones that flood the brain) #[[Fleeting Notes]]
            - I am guilty of old habits and did the classic highlight the whole book.
                - ^^Watching others reading books and doing nothing other than underlining some sentences or making unsystematic notes that will end up nowhere will soon be a painful sight.^^ [*](((4hIM0I_l_)))
            - For the next book, I am likely to take on processing fleeting notes __after__ each chapter knowing that there is __some__ value in creating my literature notes in the frame of the entire book (esp if one highlights the whole book in less than a week like I did!) with this in mind:
                - ^^Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later.^^ [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
        - In the spirit of [[designing for retrieval]], I started listing concepts/contexts the literature note I am working on I would like to find later (inspired from my fleeting note/highlight review)
            - Put some thought into the keywords that index your notes so they can be found in the context of what interests you most. #[[Literature Notes]]
        - The resultant set of concepts facilitated the summarization process. My goal was find words to connect all the concepts listed (in any order) and produce a concise literature note. [[progressive summarization]]
        - I repeated this process for the next sub-chapter.
            - #Reply-from. [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]] This is great. The concept breadcrumbs at the top almost feel like [[proto-permanent notes]] or seeds. Thanks [[Chinarut]] üôè
    - Coaching Session summary with [[Beau Haan üìå]]
        - first attempt at writing a permanent note **prior** to session in fact created a tighter version of the same literature note (looking back, in retrospect!)
            - Context decides whether everything or nothing empowers the next step #[[Literature Notes]]
                - Man‚Äôs greatest inventions come from ‚Äúnothing,‚Äù thus we are drawn to draw on a blank canvas or write on a blank page. It is the preparation of notes that externalize our thinking that allows us to go beyond willpower when it comes to writing. #[[Literature Notes]]
        - My big takeaway is to bring my WHY (ie. [[Goals for Book Club]]) to make my literature notes more relevant to my own interests
            - ^^think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests.^^ This can soon be done by looking into the slip-box‚Äìit only contains what interests you anyway. The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them? [*](((y5dDNqTm7)))

                - The book has been great!  Book club has been essential in keeping a structure to get the book read quickly, learn to highlight and take fleeting notes with an intent to create literature notes and zettel.  it‚Äôs been very insightful to learn how to take material I‚Äôve worded in my own words and project it into a context that is relevant to my interests.
                - it‚Äôs been great inventing and envisioning how communication might work in multiplayer mode - this has been a great way to dive head first into Roam and put using the tool into practice (kind the best of ‚Äúhands on‚Äù learning - by just jumping into the deep end :)
            - ((PHU7lXKIB))
                - still in progress.  happy [[Chinarut/Zettels]] came forth. I‚Äôve got about ~30 Zettels and I think my primary concern is whether I need to worry about the **number** of Zettels because as I learned from my session with Beau, one can create a powerful Zettel out a single paragraph! So I‚Äôd want to ask [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] how to best best deal with dense texts rich with ideas.
            - (reflect on goal for Zettlekasten)

                    - I‚Äôm having a hard time considering limitations.  perhaps that it might get in way of just **flowing** with a book or material - that there is something to be said  to not be distracted by taking and processing notes?

                - A trendy way to take notes :)
                - an idea generator

            - 2. Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits?
                - it‚Äôs clear when I choose to, I will take notes with an intent to create `Zettels` - with an intent for my notes to have a ‚Äúconversation‚Äù with them (not not just any old notes)
                - definitely a more bottom-up approach that isn‚Äôt as overwhelming as crates and creates of raw fleeting notes
                - knowing the difference between fleeting, literature and permanent notes
                - being mindful of ‚Äúunanswered questions‚Äù

            - 3. The book promotes a bottom up approach to note taking, which we have used in Book Club. Reflect on this. How did this feel?
                - resist old habits to use a blank page :)
                - it‚Äôs a lot of deprogramming and rewiring!
                - it feels good and at the same time to resist old habits can feel challenging, not wanting to ‚Äúchange‚Äù
                - felt good to focus on **connecting** zettels together rather than the zettels themselves
                    - it was a lot easier to look for gaps in the argument
                    - it feels good for future research to be directed
            - 4. What's your favourite blocks (or quotes) from the book?
                - wow - i feel so far removed from the book, I can‚Äôt remember!

            - What do you feel (just a guess) is the average # of Zettels that should come out of your book assuming the book resonsates highly with the reader?
            - I ask because:
                - I started the process writing `Literature Notes` that summarize **entire chapters** and sections and
                - I was introduced to the experience of being able to derive a very insightful Zettel from focusing on a **single** paragraph in your book (primarily due to the richness of `Fleeting Notes` mirrored back to me by [[Beau Haan üìå]])
                    - #Zettels [[Passionate people can support each other in the process of recovering from burnout in such a way that it energizes everyone to solve problems that matter to the collective]] z1
            - Therefore, I feel the range could easily be as few as the number of chapters in your book (**14**) (one could argue **1** for the entire book!) to the number of paragraphs in your book (**hundreds**?) (on the low side assuming 1:1 mapping)

            - now that I see it as part of other people‚Äôs pages, I‚Äôm convinced it was part of the template
        - #Chat [[Chinarut]] {{[[DONE]]}} I‚Äôm up to chapter 9 of the book and it sounds like any notes we take on the book should be in our Literature Notes sub-graph?  ~~Someone had pasted block references to the book in my page (or maybe it was erroneously~~ part of the template ~~when I copied it?) so I moved it into Fleeting Notes.~~  what is the difference between taking book notes around block references to chapter headings vs book notes around page references to chapter headings? #complete
            - this got resolved by our 2nd call. Fleeting Notes are untethered for the most part and Literature Notes make specific references to the text (via block references in Roam) 
            - I decided to combine by fleeting and literature notes under one set of book block references
                - I won‚Äôt be taking notes in the Literature Notes template
                - I‚Äôm making liberal use of block reference aliases

                - I actually find it useful and a bigger fan of a unified fleeting/literature note structure around referenced blocks
        - Literature Notes:: (section not used: about a third through the book club, I decided to combine all my book notes into a single book section below. I still use the fleeting note section for notes not directly tied to a reference in the book) This way, I only reference the source text once to maintain some level of [[traceability]] between my fleeting and literature notes (which arguably I am using an ‚Äúarchive‚Äù model for old fleeting notes rather than ‚Äútrashing!‚Äù)

                    - Pink highlight | Page: 1
                    - very few give guidance for the everyday note-taking that takes up the biggest chunk of our writing.

                    - Pink highlight | Page: 3
                    - If we take notes unsystematically, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in the midst of a deadline panic and wonder why there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writing done and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them.
                    - Yellow highlight | Page: 3
                    - good, productive writing is based on good note-taking.

                    - Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there.

            - The key to getting unstuck is giving up planning and seeing the creative flow of ideas as our source of control. By implementing an adaptive structure for our writing starting from a place of abundance, we free our brains from using tricks like compartmentalization and embrace creativity at its core. #[[Literature Notes]]

                    - Blue highlight | Page: 6
                    - A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 6
                    - As students, researchers and nonfiction writers, we have so much more freedom than others to choose what we want to spend our time on. Still, we often struggle the most with procrastination and motivation.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 6
                    - A good, structured workflow puts us back in charge and increases our freedom to do the right thing at the right time.
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 6
                    - To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 6
                    - unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement
                    - Yellow highlight | Page: 6
                    - How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated?

                    - structure one‚Äôs workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward.
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 7
                    - planning will get you through your exams if you stick to them and push through. But it will not make you an expert in the art of learning/writing/note-taking
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 7
                    - Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas.
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 7
                    - it is usually the best students who struggle the most.
                    - Yellow highlight | Page: 7
                    - it means having fewer ideas to work with, because you know that others have already thought of most of them.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 7
                    - a system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information, which allows one to combine different ideas in an intelligent way with the aim of generating new ideas.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 8
                    - Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as they focus on what they haven‚Äôt learned and mastered yet.
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 8
                    - high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 8
                    - writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing.
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 9
                    - Most people try to reduce complexity by separating what they have into smaller stacks, piles or separate folders. They sort their notes by topics and sub-topics, which makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes very complicated. Plus, it reduces the likelihood of building and finding surprising connections between the notes themselves, which means a trade-off between its usability and usefulness.
                        - Note:this brings some #theory to the cost of our personal, private graph being separate from the book club graph and creating a case for linking graphs. trying to reduce #complexity by siloing individual graphs adds complexity by not enabling book club participants to discover the surprising connections between our private notes and our book club notes #multiplayer #usecase #chat

                    - that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds.
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 11
                    - GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 11
                    - Writing that aims at insight must therefore be organised in a much more open manner.
                    - Pink highlight | Page: 11
                    - Writing is not a linear process. We constantly have to jump back and forth between different tasks. It wouldn‚Äôt make any sense to micromanage ourselves on that level. Zooming out to the bigger picture does not really help, either, because then we have next steps like ‚Äúwriting a page.‚Äù That does not really help with navigating the things you have to do to write a page, often a whole bunch of other things that can take an hour or a month. One has to navigate mostly by sight. These are probably the reasons why GTD never really caught on in academia,
                    - Yellow highlight | Page: 11
                    - What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective.
                    - Yellow highlight | Page: 12
                    - There is no point in having great tools if they don‚Äôt fit together.
                    - Yellow highlight | Page: 12
                    - this is the other insight of David Allen: Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 12
                    - ^^we need a note-taking system that is as comprehensive as GTD, but one that is suitable for the open-ended process of writing, learning and thinking.^^

                    - some career-oriented academics try to squeeze as many publications out of one idea as possible, Luhmann seemed to do the opposite. He constantly generated more ideas than he was able to write down.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 14
                    - His texts read as if he is trying to squeeze as much insight and as many ideas as possible into one publication.

                    - Even hard work can be fun as long as it is aligned with our intrinsic goals and we feel in control.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 16
                    - to stay in control, it's better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 16
                    - Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 17
                    - It is the way Luhmann and his slip-box worked together that allowed him to move freely and flexibly between different tasks and levels of thinking.
                    - Blue highlight | Page: 18
                    - I wonder how long it will take until the advantages of Luhmann‚Äôs slip-box and work routines become equally obvious to everyone.

                    - like a translation where you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keep the original meaning as truthfully as possible.

                    - it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper. The similarities are obviously there, but the subtle differences are what makes this system unique.
                    - Yellow highlight | Page: 20
                    - the best way to understand this is to understand a little bit about the way we think, learn and develop ideas.
                    - Yellow highlight | Page: 20
                    - We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains.

                - Take notes with an intent to find them later and share publishable insight. The goal is to leverage our brain for thinking, not remembering, and maintain a set of permanent notes to give us the freedom to let go (or archive or trash) old notes so the quality of our notes improve over time. This includes old project notes (like todos, drafts, etc) once the project is complete. #[[Literature Notes]]

                        - Instead of focusing on the in-between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems, reading techniques or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published.

                            - To get a good paper written, you only have to rewrite a good draft; to get a good draft written, you only have to turn a series of notes into a continuous text. And as a series of notes is just the rearrangement of notes you already have in your slip-box, all you really have to do is have a pen in your hand when you read.

                            - When we extract ideas from the specific context of a text, we deal with ideas that serve a specific purpose in a particular context, support a specific argument, are part of a theory that isn‚Äôt ours or written in a language we wouldn‚Äôt use.

                            - the mere copying of quotes almost always changes their meaning by stripping them out of context, even though the words aren‚Äôt changed. This is a common beginner mistake, which can only lead to a patchwork of ideas, but never a coherent thought.

                            - this feels like my experience attempting to post [my final Facebook Note](https://www.facebook.com/notes/chinarut-ruangchotvit/facebook-notes-has-come-to-an-end/10164316715575118/). My task was to be focused as almost everything I else I wanted to say could be found in my [[Digital Garden]]. even this attempt to make no more than 3 points, resulted in 5 (with 15 (!) sub-points)

                            - the value of ‚Äúclearing‚Äù with a coach before an important meeting/event - you are not bringing emotional ‚Äúcharge‚Äù to your network of thoughts that can indeed throw things off if the meeting is intended to be unbiased

            - We transform education by giving up the fallacy of top-down organization of curricula and teach students to see writing as a system to synthesize diverse information. We encourage them to build a simple long-term learning structure through writing. When a student sees beyond themselves, they shift their thinking and writing becomes the source of transformation. #[[Literature Notes]]

                    - ^^the long-term, cross-topic organization of notes, which is guided only by one‚Äôs own understanding and interest, is very much at odds with the modular, compartmentalised and top-down approach in which the curricula of universities and colleges are organised.^^ [*](((QVfNEbAfL)))
                        - so how is someone supposed to choose what dept to apply for their studies? #inquiry
                    - ^^Teaching is still set up for review, and students are not really encouraged to [[independently build a network of connections between heterogeneous information]] ‚Äì despite the radical change in our understanding on how our memory and learning works.^^ [*](((QVfNEbAfL)))

                        - I‚Äôm struggled to write my a [[Statement of Purpose]] (and [[one-page proposal]]s)
                        - I did have the insight to know I use sheer willpower to synthesize and that I am burnt out by the way I‚Äôve been doing it. I had the insight to know starting over with a blank piece of paper every time was part of the problem (that is was causing fragmentation). I had the insight to know there was a better way but little did I know I would have the luck to have this book land in my hands!
                    - ^^it would have helped much more if one started earlier ‚Äì very much like saving for retirement.^^ [*](((SF8pUW-gw)))
                        - *sigh* I can relate to **feeling** like I haven‚Äôt saved up for retirement ‚Äúearly‚Äù enough...

                    - ^^It is also difficult to change behaviour in times of stress.^^ [*](((SF8pUW-gw)))
                        - yes, it seems absolutely crazy to pick up Zettlekasten when I feel I should just sit in front of a blank page and just write (which we know doesn‚Äôt work very well - old habits die hard!)
                    - ^^Change is possible when the solution appears to be simple.^^ [*](((SF8pUW-gw)))
                        - yes - this seems simple enough indeed!  I am wondering what it will take to learn what are mostly fleeting notes into literature notes...
