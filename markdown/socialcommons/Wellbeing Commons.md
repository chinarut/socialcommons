- #roam-book-club [[the design for a book club for collective wellbeing]]
    - #inquiry how do we track book references and synthesize bodies of knowledge together?
    - wellbeing is universal - there isn’t one human being that is not impacted by their wellbeing practice
    - use the book [[5 Essential Elements of Wellbeing]] as a starting point
        - grounded in science
        - data-driven platform
            - grounded in the Gallup Poll (how people experience happiness in their everyday lives)
            - Wellbeing Finder ongoingly keeps people accountable and generates data
        - drives organizational corporate wellness implementations [[management consultancy]]
    - each element attracts a constellation of books (and resulting frameworks)
        - key concept: #aggregation
        - book clubs sprout as a result of book(s) pursued for each element
            - book map exercise developed in 2015 inviting members to choose 5 books to explore and synthesize
            - {{pdf: https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fsocialcommons%2FTTXSn49vBG.pdf?alt=media&token=b3627ea4-f84c-4c11-9658-30a19c63437a}}
        - element book clubs surround each of the 5 elements with an intent to synthesize works together
        - all resultant conversations funnel back into parent book club to design next sprint for collective
            - at some point, the collective will choose to break out of the framework of the 5 elements (this is a [[key milestone]])
        - other mechanics
            - leverage thematic structure in RBC4
            - leverage [[in-graph support experience]] for purposes for technical support, community help and an in-place aggregate, distributed contribution model for the knowledge inquired into itself #recursion
    - [[opportunities for coaching]] naturally emerge
