        - {{[[DONE]]}} moving children underneath a new parent does not propagate parent-child relationship [[David Vargas]]
            - Chinarut:: I‚Äôll record a Loom next I run into the situation again. I am quite certain it is an artifact of sending vs syncing a page.
        - {{[[DONE]]}} test what happens if page names change
            - Chinarut:: sweet! it must be ID based as updating the page name propagates when resent! üëç
        - This is actually intended behavior. You are "sending" a block in its current state. What should be used instead:
            - this also means that reactions to existing blocks are not propagated until sync pages/blocks is available
                1. reactions to blocks
                2. completed TODOs
                3. bullet/numbering state of children

        - evaluating cross-graph conversation
            - Chinarut:: this is a comment in @RBC-homebase-prototype
                - this is a response from @socialcommons
            - Chinarut:: this is a 2nd comment in @RBC-home-base-protorype
            - {{[[DONE]]}} moving children underneath a new parent does not propagate parent-child relationship [[David Vargas]]
                - Could you expand on more
        - Chinarut:: in RBC6, we invented a construct called a [[üêù Hivemind]]  RBC7 extended this construct and it is now a set of [[Questions]] (Q/ prefix), [[Terms]] (T/), [[Propositions]] (P/) and now [[Sources]] (S/)
            - {{[[DONE]]}} what is the easiest way to keep a set of pages (including new pages that show up with these 4 prefixes) in sync between 2 graphs? [[David Vargas]]
                - This is one of the first New Messages‚Ñ¢Ô∏è that will be worked on in April
        - Chinarut:: I am curious what happens when more complex changes happen in 2 different graphs?
            - will we need a merge manager?
            - short-term, because I don‚Äôt see our use case editing in 2 different Hiveminds at the same time (yet), I‚Äôm not concerned at this point in the game
                - the lionshare of the activity of the Hivemind is likely to move to a ‚Äúwellbeing‚Äù graph (or more abstractly, a ‚Äúcommons‚Äù graph) and evaluate our hypothesis a Hivemind can stand on its own (without RBC scaffolding) and generate discussion/discourse
                    - {{[[TODO]]}} changes to a block do not propagate (once initial version is sent) [[David Vargas]]
                        - This is actually intended behavior. You are "sending" a block in its current state. What should be used instead:
                            - Cross Graph references
                            - Syncing Pages (not implemented)
                            - Syncing blocks (not implemented)
            - {{[[DONE]]}} test what happens if page names change
                - this happens when we add/remove emojis during beekeeping
                - are pages just names or page IDs?
        - Chinarut:: the first iteration of a commons graph will **not** be public initially - it‚Äôs primary purpose will be to invite others in our Roam community (eg. [[Shana Pote]] or [[Joel Chan]]) and other experts in the commons (eg. [[Natalie Pang]]), wellbeing (eg. Jim Harter or Tom Rath), or perhaps future elemental deep dive leaders to participate with us and fulfill on a vision its all connected!
    - [[March 24th, 2022]]
        - Chinarut:: goal is the possibility of cross-syncing [[üêù Hivemind]] across graphs 
            - to be clear, for the privacy of everyone here, I am **not** enabling this extension in ~~this~~ RBC7 graph until fully discussed with organizing team
            - contact me if you‚Äôd like to experiment with me in 2 sandbox graphs to implement [roamjs/multiplayer](https://roamjs.com/extensions/multiplayer)
            - something I‚Äôm experimenting with is how to best engage with experts/advisors/colleagues/community members who were not part of RBC7 (for whatever reason) that can potentially share additional perspective to answer the question: Q/How do we sustain the development of a Wellbeing Commons? üìö
                - one could argue these are potential #community wellbeing advisors at the level of group/collective (defined by RBC7)
