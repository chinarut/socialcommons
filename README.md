# Welcome!

Welcome to the inception of a living prototype to visualize change over time in a social commmons.

This is a social experiment to drive and impact social change.

We are in an exploratory phase so if you're curious to be part of the definition of this project, please contact me on GitHub.

# Implementation Notes

This prototype currently leverages a [social commons graph](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/socialcommons) in Roam Research and [@everruler12's roam2github](https://github.com/everruler12/roam2github) to check in changes hourly.

What we feel might be possible is to leverage tools native to the programming world to visualize change/shifts in conversation (discussion as code if you will).

It is a thought experiment left to the reader as to how sophisticated paradigms like branching and merging can be applied to the realm of conversation.
